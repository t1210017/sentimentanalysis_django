Each day they teach the kids about letters and numbers, they sing songs, and make art. The kids also learn about and celebrate holidays and special occasions. Our daughter eats well, learns, has lots of friends, plays and is so happy to go to Garden Daycare. Parents get sent photos each day, which I look forward to every day. When my daughter gets home we talk about what she did at daycare and she always is happy and has learned something new. The other parents at the daycare are really nice too. 

I highly recommend this daycare."9,"We LOVE Garden Daycare! Our daughter has been coming here for just a few months and the transformation is just magical. Her language has blossomed, her ability to wait for her turn has grown immensely, and she eats so well there (unlike at home!). We just couldn't be happier!

A few other awesome details. The transition for our 20 month daughter was super well planned out and organized. Vika and Stacey communicated constantly throughout the process  and stayed on the ball every step of the way during the tough times when our daughter (and us as parents) needed a little more patience and attention. The independence factor has also gone up dramatically. Our daughter has been here only a few months but gone are the days of tantrums and extreme neediness. She's happy to so much more for herself and I completely attribute that to the love (and boundaries) that Vika somehow manages to establish.

On a final note, our daughter loves this place so much she actually asks fo it when upset. Any time she's mad at mommy our daughter screams at the top of her lungs - ""VIKA HOUSE!"". If that's not a seal of approval, I don't know what is! =)"10,"Stacey, Vika, and team were fantastic to us and our daughter Aria. They let us into their fam on short notice and even though Aria was there for only a brief time (we moved cities recently), we could feel the love, support, and dedication they have for the kids. We got pictures every day, direct/quick communication throughout, and a painless transition (it was our daughter's first daycare). They know what they're doing! We only wish they were here in Seattle!"11,"If I could give Vika, Stacey, and their team ten stars I would! Garden Daycare has been the best care experience we have found, hands down. The love and support shown for our daughter is truly a gift that you don't find at other daycares. Our daughter has learned so much during her time here and we are grateful for the warmth and kindness they've shown her and our entire family. I highly recommend Garden Daycare to anyone who is seeking high-quality care from true professionals."12,"My two and a half year year old has been at Garden daycare for the past year. Vika and Stacey are a great team. They had a thoughtful transition plan in place when my daughter first started, which I really appreciated.  I have a picky eater, and I'm always amazed to hear that my daughter eats everything at daycare (the soup really is magical). It's a huge relief that my daughter gets to eat dinner before being picked up. Stacey keeps us up to date on upcoming activities, holiday closures, and in general is extremely communicative. She makes sure to text pictures almost every day. My daughter has already been making great progress at learning letters, numbers, days of the week (she's even been asking me the time). She loves her artwork, and is very proud to show off her creations at the end of the week.  I'm very grateful that we are part of the Garden community!"13,"My little one doesn't really speak yet, and is too young to write, but I feel that she should be the one giving this feedback.
She feels super comfortable, loves Vika and her team, and comes back home happy.

As a parent I feel safe, and extremely happy to see my child enjoying her days.

It's a very warm and nurturing place, and we're lucky that a spot opened up when we needed it."14,"Our son Colton had a rough start into this world (was in the nicu for his first four months of life) so it was a little tough for me to trust him with anyone that wasn't family. I was so surprised to find how easy the transition was because of the instant love Vika and a Stacey showed towards our son! Vika and Stacey are absolutely fantastic and have become much more than a daycare, more like an extension of our family. Colton was a little underdeveloped due to his time in the NICU... Vika and her team have worked with him and I have seen him grow so much since starting at daycare. We love Garden Daycare and could not imagine sending our son anywhere else!"15,"Garden Daycare is the best place for our little man!

Our 2 1/2 year old son has been going here for over a year loves every minute. Everyday he comes home exhausted from a full day of play and fun. Its very apparent he is learning even more than he is playing. It seems that he's learned something new every time I pick him up. Just the other day he recited both the alphabet and counted to 10! I had no idea he could do either as well as he had and its all thanks to the staff at Garden Daycare.

And the staff! Vika, Stacey and the whole crew treat our family like their own. Vika and our son have a bond that is unbreakable and its clear cares for every child like her own. Additionally, Vika, Stacey and the gang are master teachers and motivators. Their years of experience developing educational programs shows through our son daily. 

COMMUNICATION. Its absolutely the best part of Garden Daycare. We are constantly getting updates on our son through out the day. Not only do we get texts from Vika and Stacey but they also send video and pictures (which are great to forward to his grandparents). Stacey also sends out friendly reminders about upcoming projects that require participation, days off, and monthly schedule complete with birthdays. From my first interaction to my pickup today, Garden Daycare has exceeded my expectations. 

Garden Daycare is full of diversity. Not only is our son exposed to kids from all different backgrounds but he is actually picking up Russian. Just the other day he was saying a word I didn't understand, only to hear Vika use it with him as we were leaving. Incredible!

We couldn't have asked for a better experience for our little guy. Garden Daycare is like no other place we visited and little did we know it could only get better. I would recommend anyone looking for a fun, inviting, warm and educational place to send their child and look no further than Garden Daycare!"16,"Vika and Stacey are amazing people, they make you feel at ease. There is nothing more priceless than finding people who geniuely care about your child and Vika and Stacey and company do. My daughter took to all staff and other children so quickly. I am so happy I am lucky enough to have stacy and vika in my daughter life. It literally feels like they are family to me already."17,"My daughter has been at the Garden Daycare for 2 years and looks forward to every single day she is there. The daycare became almost like a second family to us. Curriculum and play times are very appropriate and structured for the age. We have a very peaky eater and Vika cannot stop amazing me with the home made food creations and ideas to make sure my child is fed and actually eats. I think mentioning that we now eat soups of all kinds just like all other kids at school would sum up that department pretty well. The school has a great mix of kids (all ages) which allows my daughter to have peers to play with but also be a caring person towards smaller children, which aids us with our second baby at home as well as better playground manners :) Vika and Stacey are two hearts that were meant to care for children. Everyone who works at the school are very nice and caring, all kids love them. The updates (pictures) that the school shares throughout the day bring joy to my heart knowing she is having a wonderful time. I cannot speak highly enough about the care for my daughter and very thankful we found this gem!"18,"My daughter has been at Vikas for almost 2 years now and I will be sad when she transitions to her Mandarin Immersion Preschool. Nothing about Vika's has changed since my eldest was there. She is still the most amazing, energetic, loving child educator out there. Her staff is also top notch, the women who work with Vika truly love the kids they take care of.  Vika still runs a tight ship, I don't know how she keeps her place so organized and tidy with the kiddies running around.  I never fear if my daughter skips dinner at home cause I know Vika has stuffed her with good food.  I am so thankful that both of my kids will have passed through the Garden cause they have been taught good manners and loved on. I have no worries when I leave my kid there. My mother has even said  ""Vika's is good for her, lots of kids to play with and she is entertained ad she eats good food."" I don't think a higher compliment can be given."19,"We cannot say enough wonderful things about Vika, Stacey and their staff. I'm a first time mother so you can imagine how difficult it was for me to leave my daughter to a total stranger at first. I would sit at work and text them constantly to see how my daughter was doing and they were so responsive it totally put my mind as ease. Our daughter has been with Garden Daycare for almost a year now and she absolutely loves it there. If you are looking for a daycare to send your little one to, I highly recommend this one!"20,"What are the ingredients for a good daycare?

First of all, love. That you will find in spades. My guess is it's because its family run: Vika, her daughter Stacey and Vika's mom. And their love permeates the walls and the space and everyone they interact with which makes everything magnetic. The helpers too - Arina and Nika. The ratio of caregiver to child is 1:4 and some days 1:3 when grandma is there. Excellent.

Second, structure. You will find a developmentally rich environment with social activities done in an intelligent and humorous way (that's 100% Vika). The day starts with morning meetings, song, an activity for the day. Always, dancing and fun. Something that makes the day special and stimulating for the children. Yet, there is structure and order. Time outs when necessary and clean up time. Garden daycare prepared my son for his baby sister. They are 17 months apart and I was worried that there would be jealousy issues. Anyway, he was exposed to other babies and offered an environment where he could model his new role as a big brother. 

Third, soup. Trust the soup. Vika makes spooky good soup (and food). I have no idea what she puts in it but my son Luca loves it and has asked her for it when she has offered different delicious menus (buckwheat, mushroom, wild salmon, fruit). My son always comes home with a round belly. Overall, he eats and sleeps better with Vika than at home.

In addition, there is a lot of diversity (with children and parents), openness (communication, questions, everything is addressed), honesty (Vika and Stacey are authentic and the same with everyone) and transparency (texts with updates and photos).  Our son is now 19 months and he has enjoyed coming to Vika's for the last 7 months. We feel it has been a priceless investment and are so lucky to be part of the Garden Daycare family."21,"Dropping my little guy off at daycare for the first time (after his first year was spent at home with a wonderful nannyshare) was one of the most difficult and tear-joking moments in my short career as a mom.  Vika and her daughter and their crew made this emotional experience as painless and easy as imaginable.  They are nurturing, responsible, knowledgeable, pragmatic and communicative.  My son has huge smiles for Vika when we arrive in the morning and, while happy to see us at pickup in the afternoon, is in no hurry to rush home with Mom and Dad. 

He has thrived socially, become a better eater, and learned how to help clean up all within his first couple months in their care.  I cannot recommend this place enough!"22,"We've been sending our 2 year old son here for six months and it's been an amazing experience for the whole family. Vika's lifetime of expertise is apparent when as we see the positive changes in our son: talking, communicating, sharing etc. The structure at Garden Daycare is perfect for both learning and playing. We would not trade this place for anything!!!"23,"I rarely review on Yelp but my experience at Garden Daycare has been overwhelmingly positive and so I wanted to share my review. 

My kid is almost 3. There are two reasons that make Stacey and Vika's daycare amazing in my experience:

1/ Vika is great at developing great habits: 

My son started hitting my wife when he got frustrated at home. I tried to educate him that it wasn't good to hit-""hands are for hugging"". It didn't work and it progressively got worse. One day he hit me in the eye with his plastic toy. When I mentioned this to Vika, she immediately decided to correct his action. 

She brought it up at the morning circle-time and spoke to all the kids about the things that they have to be grateful for. That included being grateful for parents who take care of them. Then she spent one on time with my kid and explained to him how his behavior caused physical and emotional harm. 

Since that day my kid stopped hitting! In fact every time he gets frustrated, I see him controlling his physical urge to hit. What a change...all thanks to Vika!

2/They go over and beyond:
When Garden daycare had to temporary close for unforeseen maintenance (plumbing) issues, Stacey and Vika worked hard to help parents find back up care. They reached out to their network and found temporary spots where they could so that we weren't left stranded. 
As working parents, their help was invaluable. We were extremely nervous about finding an alternate day care at short notice, but Stacey and Vika were amazing about it!

If you are looking for daycare for your kid, do not hesitate to go to Vika and Stacey's place!"24,"We LOVE Garden Daycare and think the owner, Vika is amazing! My husband and I both had to return to work very quickly after our son, Liam was born, which for us meant daycare. Vika stared taking care of our son when he was only 9 weeks old. Like any parent in this situation, I was a little freaked out about relinquishing my tiny baby to a stranger! Vika was awesome though and all of our concerns quickly dissipated. Everyone at Garden Daycare took amazing care of Liam and treated him like family. Vika was excited about giving our baby different foods to try, which we thought was awesome. She is a great cook and at 7 months, our baby was literally eating whole bowls full of her soup at a time! Liam was a part of the Garden Daycare family until he was almost 9 months old. The only reason my husband and I decided to get a nanny is because drop offs and pick ups became too challenging for us. If it weren't for that, we would still be at Garden Daycare. We love Vika and Garden Daycare so much that we've asked the nanny to bring our son over for a visit! Any family who secures a spot at Garden Daycare should consider themselves super fortunate. It is a wonderful place!"25,"I couldn't be happier we found Garden Daycare! Vika, Stacey and the entire staff are such nurturing individuals who genuinely love each kid they care for. The space is clean, mentally stimulating, and most importantly, filled with fun in every nook. They text great pictures of my daughter everyday playing with the toys inside, running around outside and engaging in social activities as in story time, singing songs and arts and crafts. Since Vika was a pre-school teacher for decades she exposes the kids so many things that we don't have at home. Within a month I noticed my daughter more willing to engage with other kids (outside of daycare), open to eating other food and talking so much more. What I really appreciate is how Vika indirectly helps us discipline our daughter as she teaches the kids important life skills as in cleaning up after themselves, respecting one another and how to follow directions. I honestly feel my daughter is in the best hands everyday and going to Garden Daycare is setting her up for success when she goes to preschool next year."26,"We seriously lucked out with Garden Daycare. We were in a bind with our youngest and were looking for a place that was close but decent. We found Garden Daycare and have been stoked every day. 

When we first met Vika and Stacey, I was just excited about the energy they both had. They truly love what they do and are committed to helping you raise your kids. We spoke with Vika and she told us a little of her background. She was certified in Russia, but had to go through all her credentials again here in the US. One thing she explicitly said was, ""the American system, it has no discipline."" I looked at my husband in complete relief and in my head, I was like, ""Here! Take my child!"" My youngest has been happy every day he's gone to Vika's.

Vika, Stacey and the staff get through the tough toddler years with grace. Positive reinforcement is everywhere. Vika is consistent with her consequences. If someone doesn't keep their hands to themselves, aka hit, they may not go outside with the other kids, and instead may just play inside. There are clear and consistent boundaries. Even my oldest, who hasn't spent time with Vika, respects her and her positive reinforcement. If he has a tough day at his pre-school, he's usually super excited to see Vika to make up for it. Vika's been so supportive with our oldest as well, giving us different ways to support and help him with his strong-willed ways. They've really been a blessing in our lives.

On the daily, Stacey and Vika are super communicative. There are text messages and pics regularly, so you're not missing out on any of the fun you little one is having. We're lucky to pay the tuition through e-pay which is AWESOME. These little tech things just make life way easier.

I rarely give 5 star ratings. And this place deserves it. As a parent, be critical of where your child will spend most of their hours. For us Garden Daycare met all of our basic needs at the time (budget, hours, cleanliness, food). They've blown all of our expectations out of the water ever since."27,"Garden Daycare is simply the best!

From the first interactions with Vika, Stacey, and all the caregivers at Garden Daycare, I have felt assured that my son would be in loving and capable hands. 

Like most first time moms, I was very nervous and sad to be going back to work after 6 months with my son. It did not take me long to realize that was really healthy for my son to be in Garden Daycare's nurturing environment. In no particular order, let me list some of the greatest reasons about why we love Garden Daycare:

- Vika knows her stuff and she is honest with you. She is not only an experienced caregiver, she loves my son and wants what is best for him. It's amazing that she can provide individualized care for each child. She has provided me with advice as a caregiver and mother, which I appreciate very much as I am still figuring out this whole parenting thing. I've found out that much like my own mother, Vika is somehow always right! She knows when my son is about to get a tooth, or about to get sick, or which sippy cup will work for him, or when he will hit a milestone. 
- The caregivers are CPR/first aid trained. 
- The children are fed nutritious meals and snacks. They are fed organic produce from the farmer's market, and they purchase high quality meat from a local market my family shops at anyways. My son definitely loves to eat Vika's food. 
- They are very respectful of the health and wellbeing of every child (and that child's family) at daycare. For example, if a child has a highly contagious virus/rash, they have very strict rules on when they can return even with a doctor's note, and notify the families in daycare so they can monitor their children accordingly. They ask me how my son is doing when they know he is out sick. 
- Stacey is super organized and great at communicating regarding upcoming monthly schedules and holidays and birthdays. 
- Vika and Stacey are both very responsive by text and send me pics of my son.
- My child is being exposed to another language (Russian) at their daycare which I love and know is good for his development. He seems to learn a lot from his daycare days interacting with the adults and other kids. 
- The families in Garden Daycare are great! Everyone is polite at drop off and pick up. There have even been some meet ups for moms.
- The facility is clean and safe, with a variety of toys so kids can play with age appropriate things. I have never seen an inappropriate caregiver- child ratio. 
- They have a safe outdoor area, and they are diligent about sunscreen!
- My son is never soiled or inappropriately dressed for weather at pick up. I interpret that to mean he is never neglected. 

These are just some of the reasons why my family loves, and is grateful for, Vika, Stacey, and Garden Daycare."28,This business has been claimed by the owner or a representative.

I have no idea what she puts in it but my son Luca loves it and has asked her for it when she has offered different delicious menus (buckwheat, mushroom, wild salmon, fruit). My son always comes home with a round belly. Overall, he eats and sleeps better with Vika than at home.In addition, there is a lot of diversity (with children and parents), openness (communication, questions, everything is addressed), honesty (Vika and Stacey are authentic and the same with everyone) and transparency (texts with updates and photos).  Our son is now 19 months and he has enjoyed coming to Vika's for the last 7 months. We feel it has been a priceless investment and are so lucky to be part of the Garden Daycare family."62,Linda L. and 4 others voted for this review63,"Dropping my little guy off at daycare for the first time (after his first year was spent at home with a wonderful nannyshare) was one of the most difficult and tear-joking moments in my short career as a mom.  Vika and her daughter and their crew made this emotional experience as painless and easy as imaginable.  They are nurturing, responsible, knowledgeable, pragmatic and communicative.  My son has huge smiles for Vika when we arrive in the morning and, while happy to see us at pickup in the afternoon, is in no hurry to rush home with Mom and Dad. He has thrived socially, become a better eater, and learned how to help clean up all within his first couple months in their care.  I cannot recommend this place enough!"64,Linda L. voted for this review65,"We've been sending our 2 year old son here for six months and it's been an amazing experience for the whole family. Vika's lifetime of expertise is apparent when as we see the positive changes in our son: talking, communicating, sharing etc. The structure at Garden Daycare is perfect for both learning and playing. We would not trade this place for anything!!!"66,Was this review …?67,"I rarely review on Yelp but my experience at Garden Daycare has been overwhelmingly positive and so I wanted to share my review. My kid is almost 3. There are two reasons that make Stacey and Vika's daycare amazing in my experience:1/ Vika is great at developing great habits: My son started hitting my wife when he got frustrated at home. I tried to educate him that it wasn't good to hit-""hands are for hugging"". It didn't work and it progressively got worse. One day he hit me in the eye with his plastic toy. When I mentioned this to Vika, she immediately decided to correct his action. She brought it up at the morning circle-time and spoke to all the kids about the things that they have to be grateful for. That included being grateful for parents who take care of them. Then she spent one on time with my kid and explained to him how his behavior caused physical and emotional harm. Since that day my kid stopped hitting! In fact every time he gets frustrated, I see him controlling his physical urge to hit. What a change...all thanks to Vika!2/They go over and beyond:When Garden daycare had to temporary close for unforeseen maintenance (plumbing) issues, Stacey and Vika worked hard to help parents find back up care. They reached out to their network and found temporary spots where they could so that we weren't left stranded. As working parents, their help was invaluable. We were extremely nervous about finding an alternate day care at short notice, but Stacey and Vika were amazing about it!If you are looking for daycare for your kid, do not hesitate to go to Vika and Stacey's place!"68,Linda L. and 1 other voted for this review69,"We LOVE Garden Daycare and think the owner, Vika is amazing! My husband and I both had to return to work very quickly after our son, Liam was born, which for us meant daycare. Vika stared taking care of our son when he was only 9 weeks old. Like any parent in this situation, I was a little freaked out about relinquishing my tiny baby to a stranger! Vika was awesome though and all of our concerns quickly dissipated. Everyone at Garden Daycare took amazing care of Liam and treated him like family. Vika was excited about giving our baby different foods to try, which we thought was awesome. She is a great cook and at 7 months, our baby was literally eating whole bowls full of her soup at a time! Liam was a part of the Garden Daycare family until he was almost 9 months old. The only reason my husband and I decided to get a nanny is because drop offs and pick ups became too challenging for us. If it weren't for that, we would still be at Garden Daycare. We love Vika and Garden Daycare so much that we've asked the nanny to bring our son over for a visit! Any family who secures a spot at Garden Daycare should consider themselves super fortunate. It is a wonderful place!"70,Was this review …?71,"I couldn't be happier we found Garden Daycare! Vika, Stacey and the entire staff are such nurturing individuals who genuinely love each kid they care for. The space is clean, mentally stimulating, and most importantly, filled with fun in every nook. They text great pictures of my daughter everyday playing with the toys inside, running around outside and engaging in social activities as in story time, singing songs and arts and crafts. Since Vika was a pre-school teacher for decades she exposes the kids so many things that we don't have at home. Within a month I noticed my daughter more willing to engage with other kids (outside of daycare), open to eating other food and talking so much more. What I really appreciate is how Vika indirectly helps us discipline our daughter as she teaches the kids important life skills as in cleaning up after themselves, respecting one another and how to follow directions. I honestly feel my daughter is in the best hands everyday and going to Garden Daycare is setting her up for success when she goes to preschool next year."72,Was this review …?73,"We seriously lucked out with Garden Daycare. We were in a bind with our youngest and were looking for a place that was close but decent. We found Garden Daycare and have been stoked every day. When we first met Vika and Stacey, I was just excited about the energy they both had. They truly love what they do and are committed to helping you raise your kids. We spoke with Vika and she told us a little of her background. She was certified in Russia, but had to go through all her credentials again here in the US. One thing she explicitly said was, ""the American system, it has no discipline."" I looked at my husband in complete relief and in my head, I was like, ""Here! Take my child!"" My youngest has been happy every day he's gone to Vika's.Vika, Stacey and the staff get through the tough toddler years with grace. Positive reinforcement is everywhere. Vika is consistent with her consequences. If someone doesn't keep their hands to themselves, aka hit, they may not go outside with the other kids, and instead may just play inside. There are clear and consistent boundaries. Even my oldest, who hasn't spent time with Vika, respects her and her positive reinforcement. If he has a tough day at his pre-school, he's usually super excited to see Vika to make up for it. Vika's been so supportive with our oldest as well, giving us different ways to support and help him with his strong-willed ways. They've really been a blessing in our lives.On the daily, Stacey and Vika are super communicative. There are text messages and pics regularly, so you're not missing out on any of the fun you little one is having. We're lucky to pay the tuition through e-pay which is AWESOME. These little tech things just make life way easier.I rarely give 5 star ratings. And this place deserves it. As a parent, be critical of where your child will spend most of their hours. For us Garden Daycare met all of our basic needs at the time (budget, hours, cleanliness, food). They've blown all of our expectations out of the water ever since."74,Linda L. and 3 others voted for this review75,"Garden Daycare is simply the best!From the first interactions with Vika, Stacey, and all the caregivers at Garden Daycare, I have felt assured that my son would be in loving and capable hands. Like most first time moms, I was very nervous and sad to be going back to work after 6 months with my son. It did not take me long to realize that was really healthy for my son to be in Garden Daycare's nurturing environment. In no particular order, let me list some of the greatest reasons about why we love Garden Daycare:- Vika knows her stuff and she is honest with you. She is not only an experienced caregiver, she loves my son and wants what is best for him. It's amazing that she can provide individualized care for each child. She has provided me with advice as a caregiver and mother, which I appreciate very much as I am still figuring out this whole parenting thing. I've found out that much like my own mother, Vika is somehow always right! She knows when my son is about to get a tooth, or about to get sick, or which sippy cup will work for him, or when he will hit a milestone. - The caregivers are CPR/first aid trained. - The children are fed nutritious meals and snacks. They are fed organic produce from the farmer's market, and they purchase high quality meat from a local market my family shops at anyways. My son definitely loves to eat Vika's food. - They are very respectful of the health and wellbeing of every child (and that child's family) at daycare. For example, if a child has a highly contagious virus/rash, they have very strict rules on when they can return even with a doctor's note, and notify the families in daycare so they can monitor their children accordingly. They ask me how my son is doing when they know he is out sick. - Stacey is super organized and great at communicating regarding upcoming monthly schedules and holidays and birthdays. - Vika and Stacey are both very responsive by text and send me pics of my son.- My child is being exposed to another language (Russian) at their daycare which I love and know is good for his development. He seems to learn a lot from his daycare days interacting with the adults and other kids. - The families in Garden Daycare are great! Everyone is polite at drop off and pick up. There have even been some meet ups for moms.- The facility is clean and safe, with a variety of toys so kids can play with age appropriate things. I have never seen an inappropriate caregiver- child ratio. - They have a safe outdoor area, and they are diligent about sunscreen!- My son is never soiled or inappropriately dressed for weather at pick up. I interpret that to mean he is never neglected. These are just some of the reasons why my family loves, and is grateful for, Vika, Stacey, and Garden Daycare."76,Was this review …?77,Response Time78,Response Rate79,"Garden Daycare is a home-based daycare provider in San Francisco offering a secure, happy, enriching, and loving environment.
