Oh AND the service is great and it's really quick.  No need to wait if you are starving.  Make sure to check out the tempera too! It is actually really really good!  They have some yummy options. 

The soup bases itself are such a wide range but also very unique.  They have released seasonal items which are quite unique twists on soup.  

Honestly can't decide which soup is better they are all so GOOD!!!  The most popular one is the spicy beef tan tan! 

More importantly the owners are incredible and truly care about what you have to say!  They really want to ensure you have the best experience and take fine care to ensure the udon is perfect for you.

Stop reading this and go get yourself a bowl now!"9,"* More like 3.5 * 

Literally a restaurant downstairs of Uber / Square, where I imagine most, if not all, customers come from. This place is cafeteria-style and serves is purpose. Not really a dinner spot.. it's basically leftovers at that point. The tempura options are COLD, not even crunchy anymore. Ew. Also, broth was lukewarm, only noodles were hot. Overall, price adds up, and it's not that great."10,"Decent udon, good option if you're short on time. I came around lunchtime on a weekday and it took like 1-2 minutes to get my food bc you just line up, tell them what you want, and they give you the noodles and broth on the spot. There aren't that many options to choose from but honestly I like it better that way. I had the niku udon while my brother got the spicy beef tan tan udon. Both had really fresh noodles, but I'd recommend the spicy beef over the niku bc it has more flavor overall, and I prefer spicy broth over a lighter broth. But they had sauces like sriracha, etc available too so I was able to add that to my niku. Also, they gave a decent amount of meat in each bowl so that was nice.

Portions are pretty good but it is around $15 a bowl after tax, which is a bit more expensive compared to other quick service udon places I've been to. Overall nothing special, but satisfying nonetheless. :-)"11,"This will be a good place to go to during the colder season! Came here on a Friday night and the place wasn't busy at all. Service was fast and the workers were very friendly. I got the Kitsune Udon (#1) and some tempuras.

The highlight of the meal is the egg tempura! It's the best egg tempura I've had; it's not overly sweet and it's cooked perfectly. It's fluffy and not oily at all. Highly recommend!!! 

The udon is not the best one I've had; it's not chewy enough and the broth is too bland for my taste. The noodles' texture is on the soft side and you can definitely taste that it's freshly made. 

Surprisingly, I think the tempuras here are tastier than the udon. Will I come back here again? Probably not but if I am in the area, I will definitely want to get the egg tempura again!"12,"Decent place to come and grab a quick bite to eat! 

We came in around 7pm on a week day for dinner. There was no line, so we were served quick!

The concept is very similar to that of Marugame Udon, or to Chipotle--where you grab a tray and let them know what you want. They have 7 or so different fresh udon bowls to choose from, ranging from $9-$14. The descriptions were a bit vague to me (i.e. what is dashi?), so it was kind of hard to choose.

I ended up getting the Kitsune Udon (#1) for $9.75. The udon was okay. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best I've had either. 

Maybe it was because we came (kind of) near closing, but they were low on tempura. Bummer. They also ran out of Onigiri :(

Would come back if I were in the area and craving udon; otherwise, I think I'll stick to Marugame."13,"Looking for a quick in and out bowl of udon? This is the place to go. They got a nice selection of udon you can choose from and they'll prepare it right in front of you! It happens so quickly and everything is super fresh. I got the Niku Udon and it came with a huge portion of beef which I'm super grateful for. They topped it off with some green onions and cilantro. The broth was super tasty! They also have a tempura bar where u can choose a bunch of different veggie tempura like pumpkin, broccoli, squash, potatoes, and so much more!

Highly recommend."14,"I haven't had a good bowl of udon in ages because I really can't afford to overcarb on the thick wheat flour noodles that come with it. However, I would take exception with a world-class rendition with handmade noodles prepared by a master. This ain't it. This was the shopping mall variety, the kind you find in a food court squeezed between a Panda Express and a Sbarro. Its set-up was pure Chipotle as you decide which udon bowl you want and add whatever unnecessary accompaniments you want on the side.

Convenience appears to be the focus here, which makes its location appropriate as it sits right next to Uber HQ. I went with the $9.75 Kitsune Udon, which placed the noodles in a piping hot dashi broth accompanied by seaweed, sweet soybean skin, tempura bits, and green onion (photo: http://bit.ly/2HVJYDo). On the side was a deep-fried extravaganza that I probably would have avoided had they not prominently presented it on the way to the cashier. Showing no common sense whatsoever, I grabbed a $2 skewer of Chicken Karaage.

And then a $1.50 slice of the Sweet Potato Tempura and finally a $1.50 Potato Croquette (photo: http://bit.ly/2HZ2Zon). Truth be told, I could have survived on the croquette to go with the udon, but frankly, the whole meal was a rather bland affair since there were no spices to kick it up a notch. No fault was due to the serviceable staff who remained attentive, but I do lay some of the fault to the entitled Uber employee who couldn't be bothered to get off his smartphone to move the line along. Him I blame for his selfishness in making the rest of us wait. Go Lyft yourself.

FOOD - 3 stars...the bland leading the bland
AMBIANCE - 3 stars...big clean space and mostly communal tables
SERVICE - 3.5 stars...probably the best part of my experience...other than the croquette

RELATED - In need of Japanese noodles? Here's a collection of places I've tried and reviewed: http://bit.ly/2W7HRpS"15,"This fusion udon will take your breath away. This is everything you could ever ask for on comfort food, except for the stretchy pants you will need. (They should do that. Stretchy Pants Combo A, comes with a side order of stretchy pants to change into after stuffing your face.) 

The tan tan is particularly special because it's not heavy on the paste, as many usually are. It is actually spicy (though it could still use a little help- nothing a little sriracha cant fix). The broth and thick udon noodles makes for a perfect meal after a long run.

It's cafeteria style, so you choose your noodle fix, and then they get you with an assortment of tempura choices, nori-wrapped snacks with kimchee(!) and Lilikoi drinks and iced teas. Be kind and tip these hard working folks. 

My personal fave is always kabocha tempura, which is extra crispy and perfectly sweet and savory. The corn croquette is also a nice ""be bad to yourself"" snack."16,"I came here with a friend and we shared the niku beef udon, and we each got a shrimp tempura as well as a fish cake tempura. It was very mediocre, probably because the food wasn't freshly cooked. The udon was chewy but definitely not super fresh, and the broth was just okay. The tempura wasn't hot nor chewy, and it wasn't great. $20.62 post-tax for this food is pricey as the quantity was on the smaller side and the quality wasn't great."17,"I was pleasantly surprised by Kagawa-Ya! After working nearby for a while, I finally got the chance to visit.

My friend and I split the new sweet corn udon, creamy kabocha udon (special), and the spicy beef tan tan udon. The sweet corn was my favorite because I love anything corn flavored, but all of the bowls were yummy! I appreciated the large portion sizes and the chewiness of the noodles. I believe the noodles are handmade, and you can really taste it in the texture! The assorted tempura was also great, although a little lukewarm from sitting out. My favorite of those was the corn croquette and the fishcake tempura. 

Service is super fast since the restaurant is cafeteria style! I'll be back with my coworkers--there's a 10% discount for City and County of San Francisco employees!!"18,Received a thoughtful message from the owner regarding my 1 star experience for which I'm grateful.19,"I came here for dinner on a week night around 7PM. The concept of this restaurant is very similar to Marugame Udon, except with limited options. You wait in line and tell the worker which udon you would like to order. They prepare the udon on the spot. Once you get your udon, you move to the toppings/appetizers section to see if you would like to add anything else to your order. 

I ordered the beef curry udon since I've never had udon in curry before. The curry was pretty good, but it was difficult eating udon in curry since I had to worry about the curry splatting onto my clothes haha. I also added a tempura fish cake on the side. The tempura fish cake was really good.

The restaurant is big and there's plenty of seats. It's really warm inside the restaurant though. I do not recommend driving here because parking is almost impossible in this area, especially since the restaurant is located on Market street, which is a busy street.

The food here is a bit pricey. If I had to choose between Marugame Udon and Kagawa-Ya Udon, I would choose Marugame Udon because they offer more food options and the prices are a bit cheaper!"20,"Placed an order through Yelp for takeout. Located in the Uber building on Market.

Ordered the Niku Udon and the Beef Curry Udon.

The order was ready on time and the folks inside were friendly.

Unfortunately when I got home I realized I had 2x Beef Curry Udon and no Niku Udon.

That being said, it was very hearty and the noodles were cooked just right.

Not bad for a quick $15 dinner in the area, but wish we'd gotten to try the Niku Udon!"21,"My boyfriend and I had the Kitsune Udon & Niku Udon. The bowls are prepared in an assembly line, followed by the tempura station (our favorite part) where each piece of tempura cost $1.50. They also had onigiri (rice ball) for sale, which was filled with kimchi fried rice. 

With three pieces of tempura, our udon bowls ended up costing $18-19 which was a lot more than we thought we'd be paying but taste wise, it was really good!! The tempura was fresh and very crispy, and the broth was very flavorful. Make sure to add in the togarashi (japanese mixed chili spice) for an extra kick! The bowls + tempura were very filling and we left very satisfied. 

If you're looking for parking, we parked at the parking garage in the same plaza which charged $3 per 15 min. There's also street parking as well."22,"This is delicious udon! Came for the grand opening and tried the classic udon with dashi broth. Very tasty, slightly smokey, and great noodles. Soft boiled egg is nice and soft. Tempura is light and crispy, cooked fresh during service."23,"Its good enough for a quick lunch if you're in the area. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're not in the area. But if you're close by and want some Asian food that's quick, this would be a decent choice. 

It's all premade so it's really fast. Feels like food court quality. Soup is not bad but the udon feels like those premade defrosted udon. 

The tempura is actually better than I expected! Although it wasn't hot, it was still crunchy on the outside. I just feel like it's kinda pricy at $1.50 per piece."24,"I came here on a Wednesday night for dinner right at opening. I've been meaning to try the udon here and finally got to visit! 

My friends and I tried the NIKU, BEEF CURRY, and CHICKEN MISO udon soups. I was trying to keep my expectations neutral after seeing varying reviews here. However I was pleasantly surprised! I ordered the niku and I personally really enjoyed it -- I felt like the broth was light but still had umami flavoring. Personally I enjoyed the sweeter beef broth, which paired nicely with the spicy sesame seeds on top.

We ordered a couple sides of potato croquettes and a spam & kimchi onigiri to go along with our noodles. The croquettes were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. There's various dipping sauces in the back and I liked using the Worcestershire sauce. The onigiri made a great breakfast snack the next day. 

Overall this met my cravings for good udon. I do agree it's a bit pricey so can't make this a frequent eating habit! I'd come back once in awhile since my friend works nearby."25,"I was finally able to make it back to Kagawa-Ya after some time. It's convenient for me being near my office in SOMA and Civic Center Station. Right off the back, the service is fast and friendly. And it's hard not to miss the awesome Sumo Fish design on their wall.  

Their menu has a number of different items to choose from. For this visit, I went for the spicy beef tan tan udon.  The noodles had a really nice chew to them.  The broth was really flavorful and had a nice spice.  As a person who likes spice, I can appreciate a dish that makes me sweat a little.  And don't forget to try their tempura quail eggs which are a unique item to dip in your broth.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal and will definitely be back."26,"Needed a substantial catering order and Kagawa-Ya Udon more than surpassed my expectations. The food was delivered on time and by one of the owners, set up was spectacular and they had all the necessary serving utensils as well as menu table tents explaining ingredients for those with dietary restrictions. 

Food definitely impressed everyone. It was high-quality, cooked perfectly, and prepared with fresh ingredients. Salad options are great, you can get the traditional wakame seaweed salad or a fresh green salad topped with cucumbers, tomatoes, edamame, and Japanese scrambled/cubed egg. 

The chicken katsu was fantastic. All white meat pounded strips and topped with curry sauce. Don't forget to order a few spam musubi! Authentic, just like Hawaii and oh-so tasty. The veggie edamame is a great option as well. For dessert, I opted to get a tray of daifuku. Delicious, fresh, soft, and individually packaged makes for a great meal closer."27,It's a decent Udon place. It's a cafeteria type of place where you get a tray and your order comes out within seconds.

Overall very clean and spacious. I do believe that they priced their dishes very high. And the curry udon that I ordered was just lukewarm. Why wasn't it hot?

I think for that price and quality I'd go somewhere else but wouldn't mind coming back.

In my world, udon always trumps ramen, but it has to be authentic. Simple pass though line. Picture menu tells the story. Niku Udon was my choice. Passed on the cilantro as a topping, however asked and received a  dash of sesame , green onions, and Tentsuyu  (tempura flakes).The udon was firm and the broth (dashi) tasty. The Tenkasu gave it much more flavor. The Niku was not as sweet as I'd hoped for and a bit tough. The beef's sweetness got absorbed in the dashi, which was delicious as time passed by. The shrimp tempura was good and the Tentsuyu (dipping sauce) was ok. Just a bit salty. The broccoli tempura was on a wooden skewer and hard to remove. The tamago tempura (Sweet Egg) was good with the salty tentsuyu. Got a Spam Mussubi to go for my son. It looks decent with Furikake (rice seasoning). He ate it later and said it was lousy. Not fried enough and no teriyaki sauce. Marukame Udon in Downtown Honolulu still is the best I've had outside of Tokyo. I know there's a location in Stonestown, but I wouldn't trek for a bowl of noodles unless I got an invitation from Gold Elite Melanie B and her BF (Haha)! There's a better 5 star udon-ya on Pine Street. Just my opinion. The Niku udon with 3 tempuras and the musubi I was $24. Definitely not Tokyo pricing, but I'm not going to complain. It's a nice clean store and helpful staff. Most of them. It was a 4 star review until I bussed my plates. It's like in college where you put your dishes on a window to have them washed. There's eco-friendly compost bins. I carefully placed my discards accordingly. Oops, I didn't put my spoon in the right place and the dishwasher behind the window tossed it back at me. Dick. Fine. I tossed my tray back at him. Rarely do I write a one star review. I walked out and yeah, I thought about the 20% tip made upon purchasing my order.

They also had onigiri (rice ball) for sale, which was filled with kimchi fried rice. With three pieces of tempura, our udon bowls ended up costing $18-19 which was a lot more than we thought we'd be paying but taste wise, it was really good!! The tempura was fresh and very crispy, and the broth was very flavorful. Make sure to add in the togarashi (japanese mixed chili spice) for an extra kick! The bowls + tempura were very filling and we left very satisfied. If you're looking for parking, we parked at the parking garage in the same plaza which charged $3 per 15 min. There's also street parking as well."114,1 photo115,"This is delicious udon! Came for the grand opening and tried the classic udon with dashi broth. Very tasty, slightly smokey, and great noodles. Soft boiled egg is nice and soft. Tempura is light and crispy, cooked fresh during service."116,3 photos117,"Its good enough for a quick lunch if you're in the area. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're not in the area. But if you're close by and want some Asian food that's quick, this would be a decent choice. It's all premade so it's really fast. Feels like food court quality. Soup is not bad but the udon feels like those premade defrosted udon. The tempura is actually better than I expected! Although it wasn't hot, it was still crunchy on the outside. I just feel like it's kinda pricy at $1.50 per piece."118,2 check-ins119,"I came here on a Wednesday night for dinner right at opening. I've been meaning to try the udon here and finally got to visit! My friends and I tried the NIKU, BEEF CURRY, and CHICKEN MISO udon soups. I was trying to keep my expectations neutral after seeing varying reviews here. However I was pleasantly surprised! I ordered the niku and I personally really enjoyed it -- I felt like the broth was light but still had umami flavoring. Personally I enjoyed the sweeter beef broth, which paired nicely with the spicy sesame seeds on top.We ordered a couple sides of potato croquettes and a spam & kimchi onigiri to go along with our noodles. The croquettes were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. There's various dipping sauces in the back and I liked using the Worcestershire sauce. The onigiri made a great breakfast snack the next day. Overall this met my cravings for good udon. I do agree it's a bit pricey so can't make this a frequent eating habit! I'd come back once in awhile since my friend works nearby."120,6 photos121,2 check-ins122,"I was finally able to make it back to Kagawa-Ya after some time. It's convenient for me being near my office in SOMA and Civic Center Station. Right off the back, the service is fast and friendly. And it's hard not to miss the awesome Sumo Fish design on their wall.  Their menu has a number of different items to choose from. For this visit, I went for the spicy beef tan tan udon.  The noodles had a really nice chew to them.  The broth was really flavorful and had a nice spice.  As a person who likes spice, I can appreciate a dish that makes me sweat a little.  And don't forget to try their tempura quail eggs which are a unique item to dip in your broth.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal and will definitely be back."123,13 photos124,"Needed a substantial catering order and Kagawa-Ya Udon more than surpassed my expectations. The food was delivered on time and by one of the owners, set up was spectacular and they had all the necessary serving utensils as well as menu table tents explaining ingredients for those with dietary restrictions. Food definitely impressed everyone. It was high-quality, cooked perfectly, and prepared with fresh ingredients. Salad options are great, you can get the traditional wakame seaweed salad or a fresh green salad topped with cucumbers, tomatoes, edamame, and Japanese scrambled/cubed egg. The chicken katsu was fantastic. All white meat pounded strips and topped with curry sauce. Don't forget to order a few spam musubi! Authentic, just like Hawaii and oh-so tasty. The veggie edamame is a great option as well. For dessert, I opted to get a tray of daifuku. Delicious, fresh, soft, and individually packaged makes for a great meal closer."125,1 check-in126,It's a decent Udon place. It's a cafeteria type of place where you get a tray and your order comes out within seconds.Overall very clean and spacious. I do believe that they priced their dishes very high. And the curry udon that I ordered was just lukewarm. Why wasn't it hot?I think for that price and quality I'd go somewhere else but wouldn't mind coming back. Just not my first choice.127,14 other reviews that are not currently recommended128,$2.99+ fee • $0 min • 50-60 mins129,Business website130,Phone number131,(415) 703-0995132,"1455 Market StSan Francisco, CA 94103"133,56134,My fave places to bee!
