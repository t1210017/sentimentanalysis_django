My colleagues and I had a 5pm rez at Fog Harbor. A beautiful time of night to be on the pier and to be sat near the windows overlooking the water from inside the restaurant. We were placed at a big round table, and were quiet immediately greeted by our friendly server. 

Everyone put their drink orders in (a hard blackberry press for me!) before looking over the food menu. It genuinely took all of us so long to decide what we wanted to order because the menu is jam packed with options (both land and sea). I went for a cup of clam chowder as a start because it just felt right LOL. For my main: Ahi Tuna. Oh my goodness was I happy with my . It was seared ""rare"", and sesame seed crusted, with ginger soy glaze, wasabi aioli, stir fried vegetables and garlic jasmine rice... #YUM

No one else at the table had a single complaint and I'd say we all left pleasantly satisfied  

Don't worry Lobster Tails, l'll be back for you!"9,"Sure it's touristy, but on a nice day the views are pretty and the seafood is very fresh. My group was seated at a corner table by a huge window which offered us views of docked boats and the Golden Gate Bridge.

Their menu is quite extensive and hard to choose from. The mixed grill might be a good option for someone who is indecisive because it includes multiple types of seafood. I ordered the halibut special off the seasonal specials menu. It was a hefty portion of halibut and while it was fresh it was somewhat plain. I would've loved to douse it in some kind of chili oil, but I don't think they mess with that over here. I would've settled for sriracha, but I don't think they have that either. 

I did really enjoy a cup of their clam chowder, which they tout all over the menu and website that it's award winning. You know what though, it does taste award-winning, as there was plenty of clam meat in each bite. They really tried to upsell me on adding crab to the clam chowder, but I didn't bite.

Our server was attentive and helpful with helping us pick from their monstrous menu. Seems like a nice enough place to take visitors."10,"We came here for their ""Award winning clam chowder"" it was special, we enjoyed the smokey flavor in the chowder. 

Shrimp cocktail: 5/5
Clam chowder: 5/5
Garlic roasted crab: 4/5 (over roasted) 
Sourdoughs rolls 5/5

We would come back but lunch to get the clam chowder and possibly try something else."11,"Great food 
Good service 

Clam chowder in bread - yummy!!!!
Crab ceviche -  so tasty

Mixed grill - fresh and delicious 

We put our name on the waiting list, shaved off 30 minutes by the time we arrived."12,"The view and service, fantastic! The food, it was just okay?

Sourdough rolls are warm and baked fresh in house, yum. Clam chowder...award winning? I have definitely had way better, even Boudin's is tastier. 

My lobster roll was bland bland bland. Had to douse it in tabasco, and the roll was too bready. The fries were good, but your typical frozen fries.

All the entrees - everything was underwhelming. Seemed to be missing a lot of seasoning hence flavor.

Again, for the view and service, everything was great on that end! Reservations can be made via Yelp!"13,"Shell fish platter with crab legs, lobster and garlic noodle!

Great plate of mixed seafood. Everythjng was fresh. The crab legs were good and the shrimp was spot on. If I could do it over, I would opt out for the garlic noodles or have them om the side. The garlic noodles were AOK but not great.

Shellfish Platter Overall 4 Stars
Garlic Noodle- 3 Stars
Lobster-4 Stars

The view was outstanding. You get a great view of Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge. You can sit back with a nice plate of food in a comfortable place with a great view..which makes me a fan of this place. They also have a full bar.

Parking sucks. However, if you park in the structure across the street, they validate for an hour. Set aside at least two hours for walking around and eating.

Overall, I am a fan."14,"Excellent food and service! My waitress was super friendly. My coworkers and i had a really bad day and the waitress definitely cheered us up with her awesome attitude and smile. 
Very pleased with the clam chowder, better than the popular Boudin chowder down the street. 
I love how they serve fresh in house bread. 
Highly recommend the seafood penne and chioppon dish. 

Great location too, right at pier 39 at the Fisherman's Wharf. You can plan a day there and finish off with dinner here. Great view of the water too."15,Service was good we came here to have some wine and fresh oysters. 

I love the oysters they were very fresh. I did expect the chowder to be really good but it was ok for me.16,"A big tourist place, but the service was amazing.  They were very busy and our server immediately showed up and brought us drinks.  She was very attentive and pleasant.  Clam chowder was good and I enjoyed it as an appetizer.  We ordered the Seafood Platter for 2 and was not disappointed.  It was full of mussels, clams, crab legs, potatoes, shrimp, and topped off with a lobster tail.  It was loaded with butter and fresh garlic.  My only complaint was there was a bit too much butter on the platter.  By the time you got to the bottom of the seafood and potatoes, there seemed to be a lot of butter left.
We sat by the window and enjoyed the view of Alcatraz, the Golden Gate Bridge, Sea Lions, and several boats in the harbor.  Would visit again."17,"On a recent business trip, I was looking for a place for seafood. I chose this place because of the reviews and I thought that the three other people I was dining with would enjoy it. Some of my friends made fun of me on Instagram for choosing a ""touristy"" place at Pier 39. Oh, well. The first meal we had when we arrived in the Bay Area was here and it was awesome! 

I'm a picky scallop eater so much so that I typically don't order it when I eat out. I'm often disappointed and think it's tragic to harm scallops by over- or under-cooking it. After reviewing the seasonal crab menu, I jumped it and ordered the seared scallop and crab risotto. It was prepared with tomatoes, parmesan cheese, cilantro pesto, and beurre blanc. The scallops were perfectly seared and cooked inside. I couldn't have asked for a better preparation! The surprise was that the crab risotto was also cooked perfectly! The texture and sweet, mild flavor of the crab with the rice...I'm in love!!!

My meal was perfect! It was a rather warm day and I paired it with ginger lemonade. This was no joke. There was actual ginger in the drink and it was fantastic! 

Overall, I loved this place and I'm so happy I went. Everyone in my group was happy with their food and it was a great way to kick off the trip!"18,"I joined the wait list on Yelp (30-45 min), but after a few minutes, the bartender (Tony) noticed I was alone and told me there was someone about to leave the bar area and I could snatch that seat (so nice of him!).
The clam chowder wasn't great, but not bad at all! I absolutely loved the sour dough bread roll that came with it."19,"Beyond disappointing. Waited over an hour to try this place out. It's obvious why it's in the ""touristy"" part of town. This was the worst meal I have had in years. Avoid this tourist trap. 

Service was awful, but the food was worse. Tried the Pesto Chicken Pasta and none of it was cooked correctly. Chicken was overdone and dry, onions were undercooked, pesto was drowning in olive oil. Extremely disappointing. It's as if nobody with a qualified palate has ever sampled the dish critically. The dish also came with some sort of green leaves, which I can assume were either sautéed spinach, or basil leaves. The execution was so poor, it was impossible to discern what they actually were. I understand that fresh basil is an expensive kitchen commodity, but the price of the plate should more than cover it. The pesto could also benefit from the use of pine nuts. 

Bread appetizer arrived cold and stale. The bakery across the street has amazing bread, why not use it as a supplier instead of the crusty rocks currently being used? They're supposedly baked fresh in house, but that certainly was not the case this evening. 

Server removed wine glasses from the table before even asking what we wanted to drink (you lost a sale of a bottle of wine because of it). I find that a tad..... presumptuous? Server had little to say, offered no input on the menu, and did not go over the drinks. He did, however, refill our waters. So there's that. 

Our plates and utensils were all dirty before we even touched them. Wine glasses were not polished and still dripping wet from the wash. I cannot believe the prices of the menu items for this abysmal level of service and food. 

Cioppino was nothing to write home about. Mediocre flavor. Tadich Grill is vastly superior in every way, both in food and service, and has a far better tasting cioppino (go to Tadich Grill over this place). Don't waste your time or money here. Horrendous ending to the day.

I'm sure this place is fine if you're not experienced with fine food, but it screams ""I'm average"" to the discerning customer. Find some flavor. 

Edit: forgot to mention, the food came out from the kitchen reasonably quickly (albeit, we only ordered soups and pastas), and that allowed us to leave sooner.

My qualifications: server, bartender, and barback in the fine dining industry in Los Angeles and San Diego for four years.

For the MGMT: you have too few servers and too many hosts. The servers were all inattentive and offered poor service because they have way too many tables at once. Meanwhile, the front of the house host staff was standing around aimlessly the majority of the time. Reassign and cross-train. Was obvious from the second we walked in. Focus on the kitchen FIRST though."20,"Disappointed is the kindest word I can describe my experience at the Fog Harbour. 
View was ok. Food was somewhat average for typical tourist restaurant. My experience was totally ruined when the bill came out. 

We set down and ordered platter for two for $ 79.00. We were thinking that the portion was on the heavy side. Service was below average considering waiter wasn't paying much attention. 

After the meal our waiter, Michael Kelly, gave us a bill worth $ 145.00. When I asked our waiter about the price, he told me that we ordered with lobster tail. And he said that it was a mistake. 

Presenting $ 79 menu and giving $ 145 bill sounds like a typical scam. Hope others will share the same experience soon."21,This is probably one of the tastiest places! I was very impressed how it's in a tourist area and the food and service is excellent! The best view too! 
We had almost everything on the menu! The baked oysters are to die for! The best I've ever tasted! The dungeons crab is very tasty just messy! The deserts are amazing. We had 3!! The chocolate with raspberry and banana chocolate were my favorite. The house Cab also very tasty and great value. For sure will come back and have the lobster sandwich22,"My girlfriend and I flew into SFO and decided to check out fisherman's wharf after dropping off our stuff at the hotel. We wanted something not super fancy but a proper sit down restaurant, and we found this place with a super high rating. We got our reservation through yelp, and checked in to the restaurant on time. We were seated quickly. The restaurant was HUGE! There were just so many seats. 

We thought the ambiance was quite casual. There were large sheets of paper covering the table, like fast food restaurants. We got the calamari, the spaghetti, and the bread bowl clam chowder. 

The calamari came out first and it was huge. It tasted just alright; it wasn't as crispy as we had hoped. The clam chowder was pretty good with crab meat. The spaghetti was a bit tasteless and wasn't all that special. 

Then, as we asked to have our food packed up and got the bill, the waitress took our plate of calamari and a few pieces fell on the table. She picked them up with her hands, put them back on the plate, and says that it happens a lot. We were both shocked at how unsanitary that was, but were too in shock to say anything. We ended up throwing it away when we got home. The three dishes + tax + tip cost us more than $60, which was quite shocking too. We will probably not be returning and will instead be dining across the street at in n out."23,The clam chowder was savory and delicious. I wished they had them in cans! 

The garlic crab was just okay. The crab was over cooked and had too much butter for me. It's been hours later and I'm still choking from the butter in my throat.24,"I recently graduated from college and was looking for a nicer restaurant for dinner for my closest friends and I. My dad suggested Fog harbor fish house for the views and excellent food. Definitely should listen to my dad more as this was exactly the dining experience I wanted for this occasion. 

We had the pleasure of having Mel as our waiter who made the best recommendations and the entire experience at Fog Harbor Fish House exceptional. He was very attentive to our table and made the whole evening feel like a special occasion- which it was:) 

We started with the award winning clam chowder which was soo creamy and delicious! 

The real winner was the scallop and crab risotto which was perfectly prepared. The scallops were perfectly seared and made the dish absolutely amazing. 

Mel made this a 5 star review for me as he brought out a congratulatory desert for my friends and I to share. That special touch just showed how he really cared about the whole dining experience and made us feel so special for our accomplishment!

Overall, I loved this place and I'm so happy I chose it as my graduation dinner with my best friends. We all enjoyed our food, drinks, and the whole experience. Would definitely return for another special event in the future!"25,"The restaurant is in a perfect location. You must make a reservation to dine here! 

Customer service:
Arif, our server is absolutely amazing! 

Food:
Salmon club salad with lemon vinaigrette and lemon aoli is excellent!
Award winning clam chowder-the best I've had in SF!
Sour dough bread- goooooooddddd
Mixed grill-pretty good even as leftover. 

I highly recommend this restaurant for some good seafood in the bay. Hands down."26,"This place was pretty good, but pricey (as expected for a restaurant on the pier). We ordered a few things - oysters, mussels with fries, scallops risotto. The oysters were fresh and delicious. The mussels were nice and tasty, the broth tasted delicious with the fries. The risotto left something to be desired. They only gave 4 scallops, I feel as though it should've at least come with 6. I felt like they could've given a bit more for an expensive dish. The risotto was okay, nothing special. 
Overall, the service was great and the food was okay."27,"The views from this restaurant are spectacular.  You get views of the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, and the sea lions all at the same time!  The view is the reason we chose this restaurant as first time visitors to the San Francisco area, but the food was very good.  We weren't expecting much from the food since it's a very touristy area and we were expecting just ok food.  But to our surprise both the food and cocktails were delicious."28,5576 reviews29,Award Winning Clam Chowder30,Dungeness Crab Cakes31,Cioppino32,Mixed Grill33,Shellfish Platter34,Lobster Tails35,Ahi Tuna36,Seafood Penne37,Award Winning Chowder in a Fresh Baked Sourdough Bread Bowl38,Jumbo Scallop & Crab Risotto39,Pier 3940,Ste A-20241,"San Francisco, CA 94133"42,Mon43,11:00 am - 11:00 pm44,Tue45,11:00 am - 11:00 pm46,Wed47,11:00 am - 11:00 pm48,Thu49,11:00 am - 11:00 pm50,Fri51,11:00 am - 11:00 pm52,Sat53,10:30 am - 11:00 pm54,Sun55,10:30 am - 11:00 pm56,Edit business info57,Powered by HDScores58,21 More Attributes59,Business owner information60,Bob P.61,Owner62,"Award winning view of the Golden Gate Bridge, and Alcatraz!

I chose this place because of the reviews and I thought that the three other people I was dining with would enjoy it. Some of my friends made fun of me on Instagram for choosing a ""touristy"" place at Pier 39. Oh, well. The first meal we had when we arrived in the Bay Area was here and it was awesome! I'm a picky scallop eater so much so that I typically don't order it when I eat out. I'm often disappointed and think it's tragic to harm scallops by over- or under-cooking it. After reviewing the seasonal crab menu, I jumped it and ordered the seared scallop and crab risotto. It was prepared with tomatoes, parmesan cheese, cilantro pesto, and beurre blanc. The scallops were perfectly seared and cooked inside. I couldn't have asked for a better preparation! The surprise was that the crab risotto was also cooked perfectly! The texture and sweet, mild flavor of the crab with the rice...I'm in love!!!My meal was perfect! It was a rather warm day and I paired it with ginger lemonade. This was no joke. There was actual ginger in the drink and it was fantastic! Overall, I loved this place and I'm so happy I went. Everyone in my group was happy with their food and it was a great way to kick off the trip!"144,Comment from Bob P. of Fog Harbor Fish House145,Business Manager146,"7/18/2019MonicaThank you for the feedback and for dining with us.  I'm glad you enjoyed our seared scallops and crab risotto.  It's our most popular item.  We love hearing from our guests and especially when they have a positive experience.  I have sent your comments to my staff and will be sure to thank the entire team for a job well done.  I hope you come see us again when in the area.If you use Facebook and haven't already, like our page to stay updated on new menu items and what we are doing.  I have included the link below.Bob PartriteFacebook.com/Fogharborfi…Twitter.com/FogharborInstagram.com/Fogharbor"147,Read more148,7 photos149,1 check-in150,"I joined the wait list on Yelp (30-45 min), but after a few minutes, the bartender (Tony) noticed I was alone and told me there was someone about to leave the bar area and I could snatch that seat (so nice of him!).The clam chowder wasn't great, but not bad at all!

Waited over an hour to try this place out. It's obvious why it's in the ""touristy"" part of town. This was the worst meal I have had in years. Avoid this tourist trap. Service was awful, but the food was worse. Tried the Pesto Chicken Pasta and none of it was cooked correctly. Chicken was overdone and dry, onions were undercooked, pesto was drowning in olive oil. Extremely disappointing. It's as if nobody with a qualified palate has ever sampled the dish critically. The dish also came with some sort of green leaves, which I can assume were either sautéed spinach, or basil leaves. The execution was so poor, it was impossible to discern what they actually were. I understand that fresh basil is an expensive kitchen commodity, but the price of the plate should more than cover it. The pesto could also benefit from the use of pine nuts. Bread appetizer arrived cold and stale. The bakery across the street has amazing bread, why not use it as a supplier instead of the crusty rocks currently being used? They're supposedly baked fresh in house, but that certainly was not the case this evening. Server removed wine glasses from the table before even asking what we wanted to drink (you lost a sale of a bottle of wine because of it). I find that a tad..... presumptuous? Server had little to say, offered no input on the menu, and did not go over the drinks. He did, however, refill our waters. So there's that. Our plates and utensils were all dirty before we even touched them. Wine glasses were not polished and still dripping wet from the wash. I cannot believe the prices of the menu items for this abysmal level of service and food. Cioppino was nothing to write home about. Mediocre flavor. Tadich Grill is vastly superior in every way, both in food and service, and has a far better tasting cioppino (go to Tadich Grill over this place). Don't waste your time or money here. Horrendous ending to the day.I'm sure this place is fine if you're not experienced with fine food, but it screams ""I'm average"" to the discerning customer. Find some flavor. Edit: forgot to mention, the food came out from the kitchen reasonably quickly (albeit, we only ordered soups and pastas), and that allowed us to leave sooner.My qualifications: server, bartender, and barback in the fine dining industry in Los Angeles and San Diego for four years.For the MGMT: you have too few servers and too many hosts. The servers were all inattentive and offered poor service because they have way too many tables at once. Meanwhile, the front of the house host staff was standing around aimlessly the majority of the time. Reassign and cross-train. Was obvious from the second we walked in. Focus on the kitchen FIRST though."157,Comment from Bob P. of Fog Harbor Fish House158,Business Manager159,8/18/2019MitchellThank you for the feedback and for dining with us.  I'm sorry to hear your experience wasn't to our standards.  We take all feedback serious and use it to improve.  Thank you for providing a copy of the receipt so I can follow up with your server and kitchen team that worked.  This is not the feedback we typically receive.

My experience was totally ruined when the bill came out. We set down and ordered platter for two for $ 79.00. We were thinking that the portion was on the heavy side. Service was below average considering waiter wasn't paying much attention. After the meal our waiter, Michael Kelly, gave us a bill worth $ 145.00. When I asked our waiter about the price, he told me that we ordered with lobster tail. And he said that it was a mistake. Presenting $ 79 menu and giving $ 145 bill sounds like a typical scam.

We wanted something not super fancy but a proper sit down restaurant, and we found this place with a super high rating. We got our reservation through yelp, and checked in to the restaurant on time. We were seated quickly. The restaurant was HUGE! There were just so many seats. We thought the ambiance was quite casual. There were large sheets of paper covering the table, like fast food restaurants. We got the calamari, the spaghetti, and the bread bowl clam chowder. The calamari came out first and it was huge. It tasted just alright; it wasn't as crispy as we had hoped. The clam chowder was pretty good with crab meat. The spaghetti was a bit tasteless and wasn't all that special. Then, as we asked to have our food packed up and got the bill, the waitress took our plate of calamari and a few pieces fell on the table. She picked them up with her hands, put them back on the plate, and says that it happens a lot. We were both shocked at how unsanitary that was, but were too in shock to say anything. We ended up throwing it away when we got home. The three dishes + tax + tip cost us more than $60, which was quite shocking too.

He was very attentive to our table and made the whole evening feel like a special occasion- which it was:) We started with the award winning clam chowder which was soo creamy and delicious! The real winner was the scallop and crab risotto which was perfectly prepared. The scallops were perfectly seared and made the dish absolutely amazing. Mel made this a 5 star review for me as he brought out a congratulatory desert for my friends and I to share. That special touch just showed how he really cared about the whole dining experience and made us feel so special for our accomplishment!Overall, I loved this place and I'm so happy I chose it as my graduation dinner with my best friends.
