Big, juicy, perfectly constructed burgers with both standard and not-so-standard fried sides to choose from, including crispy-creamy French fries, sweet potato fries, fried Brussels sprouts, onion rings, and two kinds of poppers. They have various burgers with fixings on the menu to choose from, or you can customize your own. One time I got a Classic burger with their house sauce (a delicious thousand island) and cheddar, another time I did the Northern with Swiss and sauteed mushrooms, but with chicken breast instead of a beef patty - and they were cooked exactly to order and just as good as everyone says they are! I love a good burger, fries and a soda, and this place really delivers. It's not cheap, but for the quality and size of portions you get, it's totally worth it.

I've always sat at the counter, which is fun because you get to watch the food being made, but they also have a table service area. The deco is clean and modern and everyone is super friendly - great vibe! You should definitely give this local eatery a try."9,"My girlfriend and I were up in San Fransisco for Easter and were trying to find a good place to eat that was open. Fortunately, Native Burger was open! The gentleman at the register gave up the spiel on how it works and we were all of it!

They have this big flat top stove to cook the burger patties on and it really helps cook the meat thoroughly at whatever preferred temp. Once you order, you take a seat, and they bring the food out to you. Their house sauce is a thousand island based sauce. They also have some really good French fry sides which I highly recommend. The fry portion is pretty big and great for sharing!

Overall; for the price and quality of food, I can totally see myself coming back to the city and grab a burger here!"10,"I came here for breakfast with a friend. It was a great experience.
One of the best burgers I have ever had, and believe me, I eat hamburger at least twice a week. 
Everything was perfect about the meal and very friendly staff. Don't miss it
The burger is absolutely as great"11,Amazing little find in the middle of nowhere  the burgers and fries are amazing. The selection is amazing. They serve beer!  You can't go wrong if you love the burger.12,"It's been a few hours since I had a Classic Native Burger with twice fried fries, and I'm still full! Now that's a sign of a good burger! The Classic is a straight up traditional style burger with a 7oz Harris Ranch patty,  Cheddar, lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickle, and thousand island sauce. It's an excellent representation of the American classic - but with a lot of meat. If you sit at the counter, you can watch them fry up the burgers and expertly assemble them to be picture perfect.

The twice fried fries are excellent - nice and crisp! 

Service is very friendly - Andrew the co-owner was exceptionally friendly and chatty while I sat at the bar and watched him work.  Highly recommended!"13,"These burgers are FRESH. You can tell that these patties are never frozen. The ingredients are also fresh: crisp and cold lettuce, tomato, pickles, etc.

There are a few different burgers to chose from, varying with toppings. They also serve twice-fried fries, which are SUPER CRISP and crunchy! Try them with a side or chipotle mayo."14,"Great burger. Good service. But I felt way too full and couldn't finish what I ordered. 

I got the ""Northern"" which has mushrooms, fried onions, Swiss and mayo. It was pink and juicy and very good. 

Opted for the fried Brussel sprouts rather than fries or rings (the rings smell great -- you can smell them from across the street). It was a two person portion and drizzled with tasty sauce. Definitely get these!

Only canned and bottled soft drinks."15,Great tasting ground beef. Not too fatty not too lean. Juicy and good nice and medium-rare/medium. Very filling burgers. The sautéed onions were perfect on the burgers. 10/10 will eat here again.16,"We came here the day after Thanksgiving - ""Let the gluttony continue"" is our motto.

To split we ordered the classic burger and added the extra thick candied bacon.  Also brussels sprouts and onion Rings (the fries did look good though)

You order at the register and we sat at the counter.  I would like purse hooks at the counter.

We watched the two cooks prepare our meal - the sprouts are deep fried and delicious, not sure if it counts as a serving of vegetables.  The onion rings are the battered (not breaded) kind, and I was pleased that the side and the burger came up nearly simultaneously (I don't like it when the sides come up first)

My only other complaint besides the lack of purse hooks, was that the buns were too dense for the burger, and fell apart halfway though. My preference would have been for a good quality sesame seed bun crisped on the grill.

(ask for a side of BBQ sauce for your onion rings!)"17,"First timer: great food, friendly staff, super clean! Burger was so nicely put together, tasty and garlic fries were super crisp and delicious."18,"Very upsetting.
The cashier told me it would be a wait because caviar was doing a Photoshoot in the place. I was going to leave but the cook said he would do a burger real ""quick"". Thanks for treating me like a customer. The burger is frozen from harris ranch and fries are frozen. No quality just nice pics. No taste to it. Its geared to the white crowd. Back to the homeless shelter i go. Thanks for being so damn ""cool"". This place is all production no heart. I miss my old city."19,"Solid burger spot!

What I tried:
*Veggie (beyond burger)
*Garlic fries 

Overall thoughts:
*I haven't had too many vegetarian burgers nor am I a vegetarian but I do enjoy trying veggie burgers. I have to say this wasn't the best I've had but I still liked it. The whole burger itself tasted like quality ingredients and the patty was perfectly seasoned. The only thing that could have been better was the bun but not a big deal. 

*Garlic fries were great. Seasoned well, lots of garlic flavors, crispy and delicious.

*Beers on tap are available but only a few choices. Wasn't a problem for me cuz they had 21st Amendment IPA

*Atmosphere is pretty chill. Pretty small restaurant with self seating. 

*Average prices 

*Service could be better. Plus they gave our fries to someone who ordered after us. But food overall came very fast. 

*Definitely would like to come back to try other burgers."20,"Been coming here for a while now so a review is long overdue.

I think a lot can be said about an establishment when you see the same familiar faces making your food and servicing your order. With that being said let's get to it.

Apologies in advance for the mis-named menu items:
Sunrise - it's an islander breakfast with a california twist (avocados on errthang!) sweet, juicy, and in your face.

Jalapeño - mildly spicy, fresh ingredients always.

Mushroom - Sooo good! Complemented well with the melty Swiss and thick patty.

Loco Moco - a scientifically designed meal for gains gains and more gains. Pretty sure the Rock and Aquaman were raised on this dish.

Brussel sprouts - tangy sweet sauce lightly coats the crispy lil green guys. Solid ""healthy"" alternative to some of their more indulgent sides (like the double fried French fries).

It's a family friendly establishment that focuses on the burger all too well. Give this local eatery a try and enjoy a perfect burger."21,"We finally found time to return to try the off menu Trifecta burger. 

First of all, I would like to thank Collins for his Trifecta burger suggestion and Andrew who was very helpful in explaining the many options in creating the off menu Trifecta burger. 

It is best for Collins or Andrew to explain the many options to create this special burger. 

For us, we selected the Harris beef patty, hot link, the fantastic bacon and topped off with a sunny side egg. 

The Trifecta burger was huge and packed full of wonderful flavors. Did I mention that it's a jawbreaking size burger. I ate my burger with a knife and fork while others ate it the old fashioned way by hand to mouth. 

This off menu burger is a winner. I suggest trying the on menu selection on your first visit. On your second visit, try the off menu selection.  Excellent job!

Finally, as always, service was exceptional. 

Enjoy."22,Hurray! I now have a new favorite burger joint in the city! I ordered the sunrise burger and loved it. The egg was cooked perfectly and the burger was very juicy.  Also ordered the fools gold bacon on the side  too. I personally like this more than the millionaire bacon at sweet maple. 

This is exactly the kind of local establishment you want to support.  I will be back!23,"I've been on a search for a regular, good ole burger without all the frills and foofy stuff places do nowadays.  Thank goodness for native burger.  

I ordered the classic with bacon and couldn't be happier.  The burger was seasoned well, cooked perfectly, and the bun complemented it to hold everything together.  Throw on some lettuce, tomatoes, and onion...and you've got yourself a real burger.  Woot woot!  

Added on some fries and couldn't be happier.  Now if you are into all that foofyness, they can surely help you out also.  Fool's gold bacon which is probably the equivalent of millionaire bacon?  Yeah, you can add that to your burger if you're into sweet bacon.  

Otherwise, wait times weren't an issue and our food came out piping hot.  A solid 5 stars for an above average yet just your average burger."24,"Stopped by last night for a beyond burger.  It was quite well prepared and the staff was friendly.  The ""double cooked"" fries were not as tasty as I had expected.  Would have rated the restaurant higher, yet the general poor cleanliness of the place bothered me.  Hopefully the kitchen area and walls will have been well scrubbed.  The floor around the stove area is in desperate need of cleaning"25,"if you want to eat something really good come to native burger! I mean it, all you need is here. What is more, the service is so cool! The staff were totally friendly, polite and acknowledged. Wonderful.:) Thank you so much!"26,Quality burgers from Quality people. Clean space. They use Harris Ranch beef and pan fry it perfectly. I had the northern burger and it was wonderful. Savory mushrooms and grilled onions and Swiss cheese. The brioche bun was fresh and there was excellence excellence displayed on all facets of the simple meal this evening. I don't like to give five star ratings randomly and without merit.  I have a reputation on yelp to uphold. JYW highly recommends this burger joint on Gary. Plenty of street parking available. They just need to get some sports on there television monitor and they'll be just fine. They do offer beer which perfectly complements a greasy burger!27,"I'm a total burger Finatic !

We arrived before noon and was able to find seating after placing our order. While we were enjoying our burgers, a long line had formed. This place could get very busy during meal time. As we enter, we were greeted by the friendly co-owner as we ordered a Classic, a Sunrise, a Northern and a Southwestern burgers plus a side order of sweet potato fries. We started with the sweet potato fries. They were sweet and very tasty. They arrived first. The burgers arrived together shortly after. The buns on the burgers were different from other burger buns. The buns made the whole burger bigger and may have been buttered. Thus, you'll need to open your mouth wide to take a bite. The butter flavored buns worked very well with the burgers. The beef was cooked perfectly medium rare as requested with all of the burgers. The Sunrise burger was good. Forgot to ask to keep the yolk runny but it was still very good. Northern burger was good with grilled mushrooms. If you like a spicy or ""hot"" burger, Southwestern is the right choice. The grilled jalapeño was spicy hot. The pepper jack cheese added to the flavor along with a slice of tomato. The Classic burger was the baseline to compare with other burger joints. Overall, the Classic exceeded most burger joints in flavor, construction and taste. The beef patty came from Harris Ranch. You have a choice to select chicken, turkey or veggie patty for your burger. If you're looking for a good burger in the Richmond district of San Francisco, this place is a good place for a burger.
